    <p><i>
      When I first started these podcasts, one of the people I knew that I
      wanted to talk to was Meg Schedel. She works at the University of New
      York at Stony Brook. But she's also one of the people that was part of
      the New York crew that I had gotten to know over the years. And I had
      actually worked with her at Cycling '74 for awhile.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
      She always brought an amazing energy and enthusiasm to everything
      that she's done. She's also very active in the audio and visual world.
      So it's kind of interesting to talk to somebody that plays in both
      sides of that media game. I wanted to spend a little time talking to
      her, find out how she integrates the two pieces, how she works with
      different kinds of technology and how she sees herself fitting in the
      audio media world.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      All right, Meg, it's good to have you on the podcast today. I'd like to
      dive right into your musical life. From reading your CV and the
      information that you have on the web (on Schedel.net), it's a pretty
      impressive body of work. You do a lot of performance work, you do a
      lot of composition and one of the things I noticed is that you kind of
      get a sense of a person who has a background in the classical paradigm.
      You self-identify as a composer. You play an instrument that has a
      long history of use in classical music. But your use of these classical
      devices really kind of belies the actual work that you do. You're heavily
      involved in electronic music development. Your use of the cello is
      electrified, and it's software extended, you use the K-Bow and you
      really redefine the instrument in a lot of ways. How did you manage that
      transition?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I wouldn't even call it a transition. My father's a computer programmer
      and I took piano lessons from about the age of six because I had small
      motor control problems. And then when I was in sixth grade, my parents
      bought an Apple computer and my father read about this magical thing
      called MIDI and bought me a keyboard and a MIDI interface for Christmas,
      I think, or my birthday. And I just never looked back. So I actually have
      an undergraduate degree in computer music, so it's been a part of me for
      almost as long as I've been doing music.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      So then what caused you to choose cello as the instrument?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      My piano teacher ironically thought that I should develop my ear. And
      when I started cello I was just like, "What? I can change the sound after
      I've started it and I can do all this stuff?" And to me when I found the
      computer, it was like "Wait, I can take this sound and do even more stuff
      to it?" So I think I've always had a fascination with timbre and it was
      just getting the tools.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Sure. Now it's kind of interesting that your father's being a computer
      programmer had some influence on you, because I find that a lot of times
      people that work in the media arts - or in sort of experimental music -
      have a lot of trouble explaining to their parents what it is that they
      do for a living. I mean, they're always most happy when you're able to
      say something like "I'm a teacher" - because that they can wrap their
      heads around, because it makes more sense to them.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Well, they're much happier now that I'm a professor. And it's kind of
      horrifying because my Mom was an elementary school teacher and my father
      was a computer programmer and I spend most of my days teaching computers
      now. So it makes a little bit of sense to them and they, they come to
      my performances and they sort of, they mostly get what I do. Maybe not
      why, but they understand what's going on.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      That's great. So you're currently a professor at Stony Brook, right?
      And what classes are you teaching there?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      That is correct. So I have a dual appointment. I'm half in the music
      department and half in this consortium for Digital Art, Culture and
      Technology. So when I applied for the job, it was pretty much "Wait,
      you went to conservatories and you got good grades and you got into
      good schools, but you do this really weird stuff..."" So I actually do
      teach traditional theory and history and then half of the time I'm doing
      digital media courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I actually developed a course called Sound Design because we didn't
      have any courses that people that didn't know how to read music could
      take. And I felt like that was something important, especially at a state
      school where we're serving some populations that didn't have those
      opportunities. So it's been a really popular class and I'm really proud
      of it.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      That's really interesting because I teach in a in an Art department and
      it's very similar. I teach a class called Sonic Arts. They want people
      to get involved in sound design, but there's not that history of music,
      the music "process". So you have to explain what octaves are and what a
      scale might be - hoping people can get it because they have a history
      with listening to music. But a lot of times it's really sad because,
      within public education, there's very little access to music at this
      point.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Yeah. My friend from like second grade on Margaret Ann Schaffer is
      teaching high school band at our old high school, and it's one of the
      few places that still has a really active music program. Like, she even
      teaches theory.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Well, good luck to her because, well, I have kids, they're in school
      right now, and band is something that they get to do once every two
      weeks - which is really depressing.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      It's not band.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Right. It's not band if that's all that you get out of it. Right. So
      what kinds of things do you, in teaching sound design, the Sonic
      Wonderland to people who might not have that background with music? What
      are the things that you find you really have to plug into in some
      detail that you otherwise might not?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I have this certificate in deep listening which just means sort of
      actually paying deep attention to the sound itself. So a lot of them get
      sort of seduced by the surface and then I'm just like "No, you need to
      listen beyond that." And it's really amazing to me cause some people
      that have like a little bit of musical training will come in and they'll
      be all good. Then we hit a certain point and the kids that never had
      musical training but actually listened to me go further. So it's all
      about getting them to trust their ears and really know how to listen.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      The deep listening thing is the thing Pauline Oliveros does, right? Can
      you explain a little bit? Cause I've heard of it, but I can't say I know
      a lot about it and I should know more.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      So it's a Sonic meditation practice where... I can describe the
      retreats that we went on. You wake up in the morning and you're not
      allowed to speak in words. You can make sounds. So at breakfast you can
      go "Ooh" if you need some milk. But the idea is to sort of stop
      thinking in words. There's some Tai-Chi and movement exercises, then we
      do a listening meditation. So you sit and just listen. And I had tried
      meditating for a long time cause I'm kind of a spazz (if you know me). I
      thought it would be good for me and I wasn't able to - I just got super
      in my own head and it didn't work. Deep listening works for me because
      it's all about just sitting there and listening and trying not to identify
      the sound so you're not like "Oh, that was a squirrel, that's a plane."
      But just accepting the sounds, even if it's your own voice in your
      head saying "What am I doing? What's going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She calls it the monkey. you just listened to the monkey and before
      I'd been trying to shut the monkey up. Now if you just sort of pay
      attention to the monkey, eventually the monkey dies away. So I teach a
      Deep Listening class to freshmen and I always try to incorporate some of
      that into the Sonic Art classes that I run just to get them into the
      habit of accepting the whole sound like environment.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      That's really interesting because I too am a spazz and I too have tried
      meditation and it is also not worked particularly well - mainly because
      I end up with some frustration about not actually accomplishing anything
      while I meditating (which is the point, I know). But it actually seems
      like having there be a purpose of saying "I'm listening" that actually
      would make meditation a lot easier for someone like me to be able to
      approach. Now, how do you find that that actually affects like the
      process that you have in your own compositional work?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      So it was actually Mara Hellmuth, my teacher at University of
      Cincinnati, where I got my doctorate, who went on one of these retreats
      and just was like, "Oh my God, this changed my life!" My musical
      vocabulary has just been expanded by this. And it's fun besides like,
      it's this beautiful mountain in New Mexico and you just camp and it's
      just great. so Pauline came to a workshop in art and technology that I
      was a part of at The Kitchen, and we did some of her Sonic Meditations.
      Then she improvised on the accordion, an exact sort of microcosm of this
      sonic meditation. So that experience - plus my teacher saying how it
      changed her life - made me want to go. I don't know whether I can say
      anything concrete about what it's done other than in ridiculously broad
      terms such as "opening me" and "broadening me". But I don't think I would
      be the composer I am today if not for that experience.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Your composing technique, are you sort of a traditionalist? Do you like
      scratch everything out on paper? Do you tend to more use improvisational
      techniques? What's sort of the process that you go through in doing
      compositional work?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Every piece for me is really different. I definitely like to write for a
      specific person. So recently I had a violin student who had taken my
      computer music class. She's an amazing violinist. She won the concerto
      competition here.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Stony Brook, you need to have some 20th century repertoire. And she
      was just like, "I'm not comfortable with 20th century music. I would
      want to study it for five years before I even tried to perform this
      stuff. Love taking your class, love those kinds of sounds. So do you
      think you could write me a piece that I would feel comfortable playing
      that would have electronics?" And I just came up with this idea to
      write this sort of Bach Partita inspired work using a recursive
      stretching idea. So I love what happens when you sort of push effects
      to their maximum and you'd get these glitches and warbles and bubbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I thought it'd be really cool if you could stretch a sound, but
      keep stretching the stretch sound for as long as you want - instead of
      just doubling the length of your note. It'll keep going for as long as
      you will let it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's three movements. Each of the movements sort of has a different
      pitch point at which below that stretching takes place. And then, so the
      first movement actually has two lines and at any point you can jump down
      to the notes that will start the new pedal point if it's getting too
      glitchy for you. And it was really amazing to me because I like Bach, I
      didn't put any bowings or notations in cause I really wanted that
      sort of idea. And it was the first piece I've ever had where like
      just sight reading it, she got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we had to work a bit on the electronics and how to control
      them. But just working in another idiom was very interesting to me. So
      that was very prescribed. Listen to the Bach, write music!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times I'll do improvisation in a composing duo, which people
      really don't understand, called Kite•String with Sarah O'Halloran.
      And a lot of times we'll just improvise. She's also done deep listening
      retreats, and part of the deep listening retreat is also trying to
      listen in your dreams. So we'll start from a dreamscape, and then try
      to add sounds to that.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      That's very interesting. So there's another case though that is
      influential. Now I'm speaking of electronics in the way that the
      bleeding edge of electronics can provide some interesting results.
      You've worked with a lot of different technology over the years, amd
      you've been involved in a lot of different kinds of tech. How do you
      make the decision of what to use when?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Wow. that's a really hard question. I mean, how do I decide? Like to me
      it's more about how I decide to learn a technology, right? Because once
      I learned it, I know what it can do. It's easy to make the decisions,
      but to decide what to learn...
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      ...when to take on something new...
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Yeah. Well, it's getting frustrating as I get older because I'm not as
      fast as I used to be and I have all these students that are just like,
      "Oh, I'm just going to try this stuff." And I'm like, "I remember when
      I just was like that." Now I wonder - do I have the time? Will it impact
      my efficacy on something else?
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Well I'm really curious about extending that part of the conversation
      though, because one of the things that I sometimes worry about - and I
      see it with students and I see it with people trying to learn Max, or
      whatever that I'm trying to do. The "quick jump in, do something
      fantastic and then move to the next shiny object" really prevents people
      from getting real depth into any of the tools. But on the other hand,
      some of the variety of tools that come along are so impressive - or are
      such incredibly shiny objects - that it's really hard to ignore them.
      And trying to figure out a balance there seems pretty difficult as well.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I mean, to give a really perfectly concrete example, I consider myself
      pretty expert in Max/MSP and Jitter-ish. If someone else gives me the
      visuals, I can manipulate them. I'm not so good with it as sort of an
      array storage device. But other people are brilliant at doing that. But
      I can hack in visual land, and I'm, I'm pretty good with Ableton Live
      and I do not feel at all competent in Max for Live yet.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Oh sure, sure. 'Cuz there's just enough different constructs in there...
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Different constructs. And I want to be able to understand it fully,
      rather than just knowing if I do this it's fine.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Right. That's a real interesting point. And I think that's a difficulty
      a lot of people deal with, especially when it's easier to take on a
      technology that's completely unlike everything - just because you don't
      have these preconceived notions of how they should work.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      That's why I love working with video! I don't have 10 teachers in my
      head saying ... yeah.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Well, I was gonna ask: how do you balance the two pursuits to the
      different paradigms that come between working on visuals and working
      with music? I mean, they do seem to be different disciplines in a very
      serious way.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I guess for me, because I always get raw footage from other people, it
      just becomes like a sample that I can manipulate. So I don't think of
      them as very different at all. I have a little bit of synesthesia and...
      I'm good. Like I can arrange furniture, but I can't make furniture. I'm
      very good at putting things together, but not actually designing them
      myself. So I actually feel a big connection between the two.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      So who are some of the people that you've collaborated with on video work?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Yeah. One of the big people is Nick Fox-Gieg. And my collaborations
      with him have been really interesting because we'll take turns being 'the
      boss'. So, collaboration when two people are working together, you're
      incredibly equal and you should just make your decisions and it doesn't
      work. Somebody needs to be in charge. So we actually rotate who's in
      charge. Some days I will be like, "I need this kind of visuals and no,
      Nick, can we make her look even crazier?" And other times he'll be in
      charge and he'll be like, "Hey, can you make that sound? Just, you know,
      can you deepen it?" And so we've had a really, really good working
      relationship for almost 20 years now.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      wow. That's incredible. You know, that reminds me - I do work with
      a dance company, and I work really closely with the choreographer - and
      that's a lot of times how that interaction works. Especially on things
      that are gonna impact both what I'm doing with visuals and what she's
      going to do with the choreography. We do that collaboration on the music,
      and there is sort of this back and forth of who's going to make the
      decisions. Sometimes it's really useful to be the decision maker.
      Sometimes it's really useful to be the decision receiver and that's a
      very interesting way to think of it.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Something you might like: when we were living in the same city, we
      actually had a duo called In Strange Paradox where he was getting
      into doing live visuals using a Wacom tablet. We did these improvised
      sets where I was in charge of generating some sound and I had the
      K-Bow. The K-Bow was effecting his images as he was drawing and
      his Wacom pen was influencing the sound as I was playing. So you not
      only had to play or draw, you had to be aware of what you were doing to
      the other medium, and also react to what the other person was doing to
      you.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      I was gonna say that's awesome. But my kids have been filling my head
      with the word awesome, so I have to find a different word. That's
      incredible! I'd say that kind of feedback seems to be a part of the
      kind of live art work or the live performance work that I see so often.
      They have these built in feedback mechanisms. Do you find yourself
      gravitating towards those?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Yeah, for sure. Come on - I don't know why I'm obsessed with sort of
      trying to create these linkages, either between people or between people
      and computers. But I just like it. It might be because I have
      problems making connections with people in real life. We don't talk
      about interpersonal problems though, so let's keep that to ourselves.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      One other thing that I know that you're really active in is being at
      the forefront about talking about women's inclusion in media art,
      in music production, in music development - those kinds of things. I
      think you're involved in several organizations that are, that have that
      as kind of a specific desire to influence the community.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Well I was involved with at least one: The Women's Audio Mission, back
      in San Francisco. I'm also on the very edges of this code liberation
      project that my friend Phoenix Perry started. But I'm not really
      interested so much in organizations that are for women. I want to just
      make sure there are women in places where they will be seen.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      You want to get women involved in the organizations. That makes a lot
      of sense. What are the barriers that you find that kind of prevent that
      from happening?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I grew up in a town - we were right near Bell Labs and there were a lot
      of female engineers around this place in New Jersey. So I never actually
      experienced any kind of sexism that 'women can't do math' or anything. I
      went to Goucher College, which four years before I got there had
      become coed; and I had a second year math class where I was the only
      woman and I was just like, "This is weird!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I have that undergrad degree in computer music. I would sometimes be
      the only woman in my computer music classes. And I had a composition
      teacher who would actually make fun of the men in... it was a
      group composition class and he would make fun of the men in the class
      because I was doing better than they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would be like, "This is ridiculous! This woman is doing better
      than you." And I was like, "What? I'm three years in?" I was going to
      Peabody at the same time I was going to Goucher (because I
      finished everything at Goucher) and I got invited to help out with
      this wheelchair dance piece that we presented at a ICMC in Banff, Canada.
      And I was involved with the programming, sound design, everything. But
      there were 10 men from Peabody that also went to this conference and
      they got grilled about how the piece worked. We had these wireless
      sensors; it was really ahead of its time. We were working with the
      Hopkins Physics Lab, and no one asked me a damn thing. Well,
      they asked me who I was there with and who my husband was and I was 20
      at the time, so it was sort of a shock to me - because I never had
      identified even myself as female, or what I was doing as particularly
      male. It was jarring to say the least to sort of be confronted with
      my own gender.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Do you think that that attitude has changed much in the intervening years?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I don't run into that many people who are like me and aren't thinking
      of themselves in terms of gender. Like we have such a gendered society.
      I had crazy, ridiculous over-protective parents who would only let me
      watch one hour of public television a week. So I wasn't exposed to stuff.
      And I think, I don't want to raise my kid like that if I have one. But
      I do think that a lot of media and society sort of pressures kids one
      way or the other - to the point that if you ask a student his or her
      gender before a math test, the women's scores drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's this subtle thing. There are a lot of people studying it,
      particularly in the sciences and STEM fields cause they want to have
      more women. And it's very funny to me because I have two cousins who
      are engineers and another who's a pilot. These are all female. So I
      think both sides of my family have these strong women who don't care.
      but all of us are, "Why aren't there more? This is weird." And they've
      actually done studies, and the main thing that they find is that if you
      see other people who are like yourself (if you see a woman doing
      something) you're more likely to think you can do it. So that's pretty
      much why I'm just like: "Hey, put a woman on it."
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      That's interesting because one of the things that, as you were talking,
      I was wondering if you thought that... that some of this push, whether
      it's through STEM or whatever, where we have to get women to do better
      at math - if that doesn't ghettoize women who already do math. But I
      do see where where having people visibly in that environment makes a
      huge difference.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I mean, I'm not even advocating for 50, 50 balanced programs; but, I
      know that I've had some opportunities presented to me just because I'm a
      woman - but I take them and I run with them. I've gotten to the point of
      saying, "Now, do you want me just because I have a vagina? Because I
      also have seven friends who could do this, who also have vaginas." People
      say, "Oh, there are more people?" I'm like, "Yes, I have a whole
      binder full of them!" And I literally have a list of a hundred
      emails for when people are like, "I couldn't think of anybody."" I'm like,
      here you go. I send the list with like "They're a
      composer, they're a researcher, they're a performer. This is what
      they've done." And I will send it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like, you think there's not a woman - here you go. And I really kind of
      want to get now into doing that for minorities as well. It is a
      little bit annoying. You're the token woman or you're the token
      minority, but you being there could change the course of someone in
      the audience's life.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      I think that's a great point because I think that so often those kinds
      of influences are not the ones that cause people to come rushing up
      after a performance or after a speaking engagement. They don't come
      up and say, "You changed my life!", you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think there's any other things that need to change in order to
      make electronic music or media art or interactive video become a better
      environment, or environment that that is more easily seen as not gendered?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I'm hoping maybe these MOOCs, these distributed classes where you can
      take it in the shelter of your own home are gonna be useful. So it's
      really funny: my Kindle is sitting right here, the Virginia Woolf
      picture is up and she's... You know, back in the day it was very hard to
      become a painter or a musician because you needed to intern with
      somebody and she was like, all you need to become a writer is to have
      a pen and some paper and a room of your own. And I'm thinking that the
      computer is starting to become that room of one's own. Just trying to
      put tools out there so that you can experiment in your home and get
      some confidence before going out into the world.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, because there's a screen between the
      class and yourself. It means that you can be whoever you are, and that
      makes a lot of sense. So when I think about you, I tend to think of
      you as one of the "New York People", right? But it maybe some of it is
      because every time I run in into you, and Luke Dubois's there and Todd
      Reynolds is there and you know, all my New York people.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Awesome. Reynold went to Stony Brook.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Did he really? Yeah, I didn't know that at all.
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      We're going to have it out for like an alumni concert hopefully in
      November if the dates work out.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Oh, that's cool. So what about that kind of environment seems to you to
      activate the leading edge of art and music? And, and the combination of
      the two?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I moved from Cincinnati to San Francisco - and I think it was really
      important for me to be in San Francisco because my doctorate had kind
      of beaten me down a bit. I had some professors at Cincinnati who did not
      believe that what I did was music. I did this giant opera that I thought
      was my thesis, and I got told because it was so collaborative that they
      couldn't figure out what my part was in it. So it couldn't be my thesis.
      And I'm just like, "I sold out three nights at the Contemporary Art
      Center. I got profiled by Apple, I worked for two years bringing a team
      together. I dictated the form of everything and let people go and do
      things on their own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like I had eight channels of audio that were controlled by a motion
      sensor. And I didn't want to write those eight tracks myself. I wanted
      each one to have a really distinct voice. But I told people, these are
      the kinds of samples that I want to have. This is when it's day. This is
      when it's night. This is how crazy they should sound.
    <p>
    </p>
      And so I got eight very, very distinct soundtracks, but the faculty
      could not wrap their heads around the fact that that was me composing.
      It was like Xenakis - "I'll put the structure in and then the stochastic
      cloud particles will fill in the details..."
    </p>
    <p>
      So San Francisco was really important for me
      because everyone there was so accepting and positive. But I'm glad that
      I moved back to New York where they're like, "Oh, I saw that you did
      that a month ago. What have you done since?""
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      It's an incredible push, isn't it?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Snd I'm somewhat grateful, but I did not go to school in New York either.
      And then I was sort of able to come back and be formed and be new and
      competent.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Do you think that there's a sense that in the New York performing
      environment that it preferences people that go away for awhile and then
      come back in - so that you're not the person I see at the corner store and
      now I see you performing and...
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      Luke and Todd have been there forever. So I think it's hard to be the
      person that goes there for your doctorate only and then stay. But if you
      were there sort of from the beginning...
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Right. For the long run. So speaking of what's new this month, is there
      anything that you've seen lately that you find particularly exciting?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      I mean it's not music, but I went to see the James Turrell exhibit
      at the Guggenheim and it blew my mind and made me hear a sound and I
      was just like, "I want to put sound in there." And I'm really, really
      excited about the the MoMA show on Sound Art, and I'm going to get a
      backstage tour because, oddly, my husband who works with x-rays is
      doing some thing for MoMA and they're grateful and they're like,
      "Whenever you want a backstage tour, let us know." And I was like, I
      want a backstage tour once the Sound Art show comes up. So very excited
      about that. And yeah, it should be good.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Excellent. Meg, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.
      Are there any last words you want to toss out there?
    </i></p>

    <p><b>Margaret: </b>
      No, it would always be like something cheesy, like, "Do what you love!"
    </p>

    <p><b>Darwin: </b><i>
      Well, okay, we'll use that as a tagline then. Thank you very much and
      have a great day.
