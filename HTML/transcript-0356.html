      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today, I have the great pleasure of getting to meet somebody. The contact just came out of the blue, about, a little company running out of Argentina. I looked into it and I was pretty shocked with what I saw. I started conversation.
        And the next thing I know, we set up an interview and I am very glad to introduce you all to Alejo Fernandez, Yale, he and his brother, I think run a company called Yale. <span style="color:red" data-ts="30.6" data-end_ts="31.17" title="30.6"
          id=c_"30.6">__Yaeltex__</span> have I gotten all that right. So far. It's perfect that way. Okay. Yeah. All right. Perfect. All right. Excellent. And what they do is actually quite amazing. They have a factory where they develop mini
        controllers, but it's not the typical preset mini controller with a lot of functionality stuff. They actually have gone way out of their way to make a system, make a whole environment. In essence, that allows you to design manufacture and get
        your own custom mini controller. And it's amazing. So rather than try and ramble about it myself, first of all, I'm going to have you look over at, Yale texts. That's Y E L T E x.com where you can actually see their stuff at work, but also
        we're going to talk to Alejo. So with no further ado, let's talk to him. Hey man, how's it going? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo Yael: </b>
      And, thank you for having me. It's really an honor to be in your podcast, which I heard many times and which I learn a lot from. So thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It's good to know that I have some listeners in Buenos Aires. That's very exciting to me now. I was, I was really kinda knocked out with what you guys are doing. Why don't you talk a little bit
        about the way that you tell people about your company? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Okay. So we built a system for creating custom interfaces. And what we actually tried to do is to remove all the complexity of creating our word and mask it behind a simple interface, which is a web app where you can easily design your
      controller or interface without all the hassle that comes with it, which we learned from experience. It's a lot and it's very hard. So yeah, we, we built this system, which has different parts. We can talk later about them on the front end.
      It's a web <span style="color:red" data-ts="160.54" data-end_ts="160.67" title="160.54" id=c_"160.54">__app__</span>. It's a very easy design up where we actually embed all our framework, the hardware framework and everything you can design
      there, we can build. So in a sense <span style="color:red" data-ts="173.42" data-end_ts="173.69" title="173.42" id=c_"173.42">__is__</span> it's like a service and a product at the same time. And so this, this application is called the factory
      and there's where you can, design and build your controller. And we try to do the customization as extensively as we could. I would like to keep in mind that this is the first version and we were really eager to put it on the streets. So we
      been developing it for maybe two years. And when we felt that we have a viable product, we put it out there because we wanted actually to build with the input from the community. So built publicly, let's say so it's more or less around those
      lines
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right now. I think in a way we're almost doing it a disservice by calling it a mini controller too. When I look at the range of things that you can actually build with this, it's pretty amazing because you have everything, you have the
        typical sliders and knobs and buttons, but you also have like grid or res you have are keyed buttons. You have, it looks like you even have joysticks. All of these things can be arbitrarily placed anywhere on a control surface, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Yeah, that's right. I also don't like it to call it only a MIDI controller, which is completely fine. But, we are actually also implementing, for example, keystrokes. So it's not really a MIDI controller and we are also aiming for twitchers and
      video streamers and video editors and also maybe gaming and at some point, but yeah, as I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.3" data-end_ts="273.45" title="273.3" id=c_"273.3">__it's__</span>, it's like the first version and we have
      plans to put more elements into it, but right now, yes, you can, you can put joysticks and ARCA, photons and different also rubber buttons with RGB feedback and yeah. And coders and stuff like that. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>It's really quite amazing now, where are these things manufactured? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Okay. So we are based in when a site is <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.28" data-end_ts="299.64" title="299.28" id=c_"299.28">__surgeon__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.64" data-end_ts="299.97" title="299.64"
        id=c_"299.64">__Dina__</span>. So we Mount the things here and all that were, there are some providers that we have here in Argentina, for example, the faceplates like the front panels and all this work and the cases, the cases are built by a
      very good friend from us <span style="color:red" data-ts="316.68" data-end_ts="317.55" title="316.68" id=c_"316.68">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, which is a amazing carpenter. And they are done by hand in Patagonia. And Bariloche where we all
      come from. Actually, we are four main founders and we are all from Bariloche friends since we were kids. And, and Thomas is still in Bariloche that it's making the wood boxes and then all the design and, industrial design and coding and stuff
      is done in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="344.67" data-end_ts="344.91" title="344.67" id=c_"344.67">__Bruno__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="344.91" data-end_ts="345.42" title="344.91" id=c_"344.91">__Citus__</span>, Argentina. And
      we manufacture the elements, which is the electronics and China.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. But it's, I mean, it's really interesting because, you know, I, I think one of the things that surprised me initially is that you just don't simply hear an awful lot about manufacturing in South, South America, especially something
        that's single shot, custom development. I mean, this is really, really pretty amazing. How, how hard was it for you to get the infrastructure going to even make this happen? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      You don't hear it much because if you think it it's a really bad idea. I mean, we started because we were passionate about it. If we have started as a business, making a spreadsheet with numbers, we will never start. I mean, it's, it's really
      about idea, and this is why we don't see much from, South America. But that's, that doesn't mean there is none. I mean, there are quite a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="406.81" data-end_ts="407.11" title="406.81"
        id=c_"406.81">__into__</span> really interesting projects in Argentina and also some in Peru and Brazil and Sheila in Hawaii. But it's not a good idea because, yeah, developing a business in, in, well, I can speak for my experience in
      Argentina. It's, the starting a project anywhere in the world. It's a, it's a major challenge. And I have the most respect for the people that get to take the ideas out of their head and make something real.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      That's an amazing challenge. And it's already a lot of work, but if you add to that to make it in a place like Argentina, it's a really, really tough. But anyway, we, as I said, we started without thinking about the business we started because
      we like it. And here we are, actually, the thing is that we, you have to be really flexible, the rules and the game is changing by the day here in many, in many ways. Right? So it's a real challenge, but it's possible. I mean, we are, we are
      here and we'll live through the pandemic, which was also hard. So we are an example that it's possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, not only is it possible, it's kind of like, amazing. I mean, again, this kind of like one-off development stuff is, is really cool. The idea of using web, web tooling, both for designing the device itself, as well as for configuring,
        it is really kind of bleeding edge as well. And so congratulations on that. That's amazing. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="503.41" data-end_ts="503.59" title="503.41" id=c_"503.41">__May__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="503.59" data-end_ts="503.62" title="503.59" id=c_"503.59">__I__</span> add something to that? There is
      something that it's not so evident that is that this model allow us to have a product on the market. You know, making hardware is really expensive and, to get into the business, it's, it's really expensive if you have to send to a manufacturer
      in China, I don't know, a thousand to 500,000 to 10,000 units, right? Yeah. Yes. So this which it's stuff that we are discovering as we go, but this for us was, was a, an amazing finding somehow that we can make short batch of the things that
      we have to bring from China. And this, allow us to, on the first hand to do not have things that are standing in a bench that we are not selling, that we don't, we don't build anything that it's not wished already, but someone, so we don't have
      this fight for prices or be <span style="color:red" data-ts="564.81" data-end_ts="565.17" title="564.81" id=c_"564.81">__stock__</span> that we have to sell cheaper. And on the ecological point of view, this is also very interesting because
      what we manufacture, it's not defined what it's going to be. It's still someone we should tell someone wanted. And so that is also an interesting part of how we came into hardware. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's a really great point. And especially I like the, the ecology angle of it, the fact that you're, you're not wasting development because the things that are, you know, you only build the things that actually people want to have in their
        studios. So that's fantastic. So I am curious, you, you, you dropped a little note about the speed business has having been started by a bunch of you that grew up in Patagonia. And, I am curious about your background. How did you, frankly, I
        think of Patagonia primarily as a place where people go for, interesting outdoor tourism. I don't think of it as a place where people are sitting around designing ideas for a mini controller based business. So I became curious about where
        does, <span style="color:red" data-ts="642.08" data-end_ts="642.32" title="642.08" id=c_"642.08">__so__</span> where does this passion come from? How did you know growing up, how were you interacting with electronic music? What got you
        interested in working on electronics and design and these other things, how did you get to the place where you are putting something like this together? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      So, yeah, we, as I said, we are from, Bariloche, I mean, the, the music part in my case, and in the case of Mateo, my brother comes from my mother, surely she was, completely, music fun. And she was into Frank Sapa and Beatles and pink Floyd
      and sapling, and like Saba and Janis Joplin and all this thing that were, I don't know, popular in the sixties and the seventies. So we grew up listening to all this music. And to me, the experience of listening to pink Floyd as a kid, it was,
      it was sublease and <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.59" data-end_ts="699.68" title="699.59" id=c_"699.59">__it's__</span> something that stays with me forever actually. And on the, on the other hand, our uncle it's a physician and he works
      in a place called the atomic center where he, yeah, experimenting with electrons and stuff like that in a lab called atomic collisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      And they were starting, you know, crushing particles to see what happened there. And as a kid, I remember to be fascinated and asked and asked my uncle many and many, many times to take me there because I was fascinated by the machines that
      we're using. And they were building everything there to make the experiments. And there were all kinds of crazy interfaces to, yeah. To drive their reactor and to make all these experiments with, with the electrons and stuff. And that's also
      stays with me. I remember making visuals go in there to take pictures and to use it as a content because it was, it blew my mind. And, yeah, I think a part of the fascination with the machines come from that iteration. And later with my
      brother, we got into music and visuals and interaction and installations. So at the time I was living in Germany for a while in the early two thousands, and I came back to Argentina and I have some tools with me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      And one of them was a little box from a company called electro top, which I think it's gone by now <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.42" data-end_ts="799.57" title="799.42" id=c_"799.42">__has__</span> company. Yes, yes. From <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="801.61" data-end_ts="802.12" title="801.61" id=c_"801.61">__***<inaudible>***__</span>. Yeah. And they have a box called the Teabox. Right. And we love it at the time. It was a little box where you can connect
      easily with cables that you can build yourself some sensors. And the first interface that we did with my brother was a to using the Teabox and building something we call <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.61" data-end_ts="823.45"
        title="822.61" id=c_"822.61">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, which was an interface with a gyroscope and accelerometers and distance sensors and flexors four sensors that you can interact with it. And we got fascinated by the process of
      building this thing. And from there really short after Franco Rossano, which is, an electronic engineer, join us to build more complex stuff. And we start using <span style="color:red" data-ts="851.26" data-end_ts="851.63" title="851.26"
        id=c_"851.26">__Topfer__</span> for boards and then the brain form from <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.04" data-end_ts="855.31" title="855.04" id=c_"855.04">__a__</span> live with instruments. And at the time we find Arduino and this
      opens a lot of possibilities for us and was very cheap at that time in Argentina, it was not very easy to import stuff. So we ask, you know, anyone like the grandmother of a friend that was flying abroad to bring us components and things to
      work with, and also repurposing stuff that we find here, like, I don't know, PlayStation joysticks and put them apart and using the PCVs to make something else with it. Because again, we didn't have access to buy new stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>You were using all of this for your own music and visual. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Yeah. And we had a little company where we did, installations for brands and also for other artists. So we helped them like put systems together where you need to synchronize light and video and audio. And we were using at the time, pure data
      and max MCP and, any <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.72" data-end_ts="926.29" title="925.72" id=c_"925.72">__Salata__</span>, which I still loved, today and yeah, max for life. And then I don't remember the year, but when Apple it on line
      four, came out with a meat implementation, we start to use it extensively also to sequence stuff. And so we were losing this interfaces for pieces, for brands or for other artists that were doing installations and inter interactivity, but they
      didn't knew exactly how to put the system together as some kind of technical assistance, if you will.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure, sure. Now you talk about there being kind of like four people involved in this business. Do each of you do have like one role, like is one person the software designer and one person the hardware designer, or does everybody kind of
        work on everything? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      We are four, but there is actually more people involved now. Yeah. Some of them are not working full time, but they are engaged in the project, in the project for a long time. And, but actually each of us has an area which is responsible, but
      we are really mixed because we need to do a lot of stuff. So it's, it's a lot of work. So we ended up doing different things, but Franco it's responsible for the electronic design and, and the Fillmore mostly with the development, but then we
      all designed together, you know, features and blah, blah, blah. We don't have a vertical organic, vertical organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure, sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, when I look at the range of devices that, I mean, if nothing else, when you pop open your website, like the image at the top is like, it's like a circus of different kinds of controllers.
        It's really, it's really pretty amazing when you're developing these things are like, do these components come in like little mini sets and they're kind of assembled together? Or do you have to like build up the component boards from scratch
        for each one? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      No, we, I mean, we send it to, to manufacture in China, we get the board already populated. We used to do it too to make the oldest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1065.46" data-end_ts="1065.88" title="1065.46"
        id=c_"1065.46">__soldier__</span> here, but we don't add value doing that anymore. And so we outsource it, but we did it. I mean, what we are seeing now is what we call version two. And we have, version one, which was a primitive version of
      this based on Arduino and based on a shield we developed for Arduino. And also, I see, and we did like a hundred different units and between 2000, 2017 and two, 2019 with this first version, it was much more of a going and coming with the
      artist and by mail. And so it was really work intensive and it didn't make a lot of sense on the financial, on the financial side, because it's impossible to charge for that work. So for version two, we try to automate all this process and also
      to give the freedom to the artists, to design it by themselves, which we didn't have before. But coming back to your question, yes, they can populate it. The PCBs and what we do here is to, is to mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay. And, one of the thing that I noticed, or one of the things that kind of jumps off the page too, when you scroll through it, is that you still have like, like the cases are still made back in Patagonia by your friend, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      I mean, this has to do with the, we think of beauty as a feature, to not as a destiny, to a very simple thing is that beautiful things makes people happy. And it's a, it's a very basic, but it's very powerful. So there are some parts of our
      product that we want to keep as beauty as we can when it makes economic sense. So yeah, we still do the boxes with Tomas in Patagonia.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i><span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.65" data-end_ts="1176.83" title="1176.65" id=c_"1176.65">__Hmm__</span>. Yeah. I think that that's actually really an important point. And, you know, I know some of the favorite things that I have in my
        studio, like the monochrome grid or the manta from, Jeff Schneider, I mean, a big part of it is that physically they're beautiful and that physical beauty makes me appreciate them as an instrument. And I treat them in kind of a different way.
        And I, and so I think that that's really important. I think that's really smart in putting together a accustomed thing. I imagine already you've seen like some pretty crazy designs come through. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Yeah. I mean some, yeah, we, we expect when building, some how an open system, the rest, a lot of work imagining in your head, all the different possibilities that can come out with this set of rules that we are putting out, but it's impossible
      to pre understand everything that will be made there. And it's, it's amazing. It's a, it's a really, a really fascinating part of the, of the process is watching what the people come out with. We saw like a sets, composed of 10 pieces. I mean,
      10 different urinates to make a massive, interface or, or, or yeah. Or some people just choosing joysticks and making a massive plate of joysticks and stuff like that. Yeah. I think now we are preparing a new set of, hardware elements that we
      will bring into the framework. And we are breaking a little bit to the symmetry of the system right now you can fill it some kind of primitive because we have this very fixed grid. But now we are breaking this, symmetry, bringing more,
      components on the same area. So I think we will start to see more diversity on, on, on the, on the controllers being made on the factory.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. Now, although there are many controllers, different kinds of software have different kind of interface requirements. So like with, with even life, for example, a lot of preset controllers will have a Python script that gets embedded so
        that it is automatically, kind of assigned. Have you done any work to sort of like standardize that connection with soccer or how do you help people get this integrated into software into the, the software that it's connected to? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Well, it's a, it's a complicated subject somehow because every software has a different implementation. So it's a thing that going one by one with the softwares right now, we are working with, James Westfall, which is a guy from States it's
      really good, by building a remote scripts and we are finishing, I don't want to be too optimistic, but maybe in two or three weeks, we're gonna release a remote script that is modular as our controller. So we will let people interface with
      Atlit on easier than now. But to be honest, there are already options on the market to, overcome this like, remote defy. For example, there are some tools already, on the market that will help you building your own Python, remote script for
      avatar, and then QA is, are some more, friendly configuration inside of, of Cubase.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      You can do your own script somehow and also save it. So every time you open Cubase, you will have your controller behave as one. And then, there is also in between, for example, there's also some kind of a generic, remote script that you can,
      it's really powerful. You can control anything, but, yeah, it's, it's something, we are working on. And on our side, we have a kilowatt, which is the tool that led to you reconfigure your controller and the way you want. And anytime you want,
      it's also a web app and it's quite powerful in the sense that you can configure the component, that the way you want in the sense that you can send it to one port, to other port, to a specific media channel with a specific media message and so
      on. So I think with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.86" data-end_ts="1459.05" title="1458.86" id=c_"1458.86">__any__</span> new universal script that we are releasing very soon and, with the other software that already have these
      capabilities built in, and there is a kind of support for that. Yeah,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>No, what are the limits of what you can build? I mean, obviously you can't build something, that's the size of a ship. So like, what is, what is the limit of the interface size that, that people can design? </i>
    </p>

      So, that is, we have, three different sizes now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.62" data-end_ts="1490.86" title="1490.62" id=c_"1490.62">__then__</span> you can use or resentfully or vertically. So there are actually like 60 different
      phone factors if you will. And the biggest one is something like 45 centimeters by 33. And so it's, that's the biggest controller, we can build now, but we are also planning as, yeah. You know, when we built a system, we thought, we would build
      it to be X, expandable in the future. So the main board that we have inside of the, of the controllers, what that we call <span style="color:red" data-ts="1527.61" data-end_ts="1528.24" title="1527.61" id=c_"1527.61">__***<inaudible>
          ***__</span> it's, being used, no, so sensitively. So there is a lot to add to the, to the killer mode. So we cannot, we will add in the future screens and, Reborns and different sensors, and I dunno, motorized, faders and so on. And, we
      are limited by our resources. That's really the point. I mean, the ability for us to develop, new elements and also the financial ability to produce a bigger system because we have to produce batches of the electronics. And so when we have more
      elements <span style="color:red" data-ts="1565.35" data-end_ts="1565.5" title="1565.35" id=c_"1565.35">__at__</span> some more expensive and we have, you know, be clever about

      <i>That makes a lot of sense now, to what extent maybe I have just a misunderstanding, but one of the things that I, that my understanding about arts and Tina in particular was that import duty is actually a real difficult thing to deal with
        for, for businesses or even for musicians that want to give instruments, you know, from the outside world and stuff, doesn't that have a significant effect effect on your ability to produce these things. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Right now it's working. And I mean, I don't think it's understandable for someone that it's not from Argentina, what we go through here right now, it's working. And I don't want to say it too loud, but right now it's working, we can bring stuff
      in and we can export our stuff out. And most of the things, because we are going through a complicated economic situation here in Argentina, most of our clients are, are outside of Argentina, and this is, somehow sad for us, but, it's what it
      is. But right now we can pretty, easy bring the things that we need in, and then to export the things that we do out. But that wasn't, that wasn't the case four years ago. And we will see what happened in two years from now.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay. Right. So it is a fluid situation. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Yes. It's by today, as I said, it's a better, it's not the only thing really building a company or a project in Argentina has many of those, uncertainties and, difficulties, access to credit. I can, I can name like 20 that you have in the
      States or in Germany or in England, on, in Spain that you, that you have there. And we, we, we don't, for example, a coin that we can use. I mean, we have, we have a coin that is, we cannot hold it for 10 days because it's devaluated all the
      time. Oh my goodness. Yes. Yeah. And stuff like that. It's, it's really a challenge. Also, let me add that. I'm not proud of this, but this situation it's, for entrepreneurs like us, it makes us very flexible and adaptable. And, I, I'm not
      proud of it. I don't want to be flexible and adaptable, but yeah, it's what we have to do. And, if you don't, you can't do stuff here. I mean,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>It seems to me, like not only your background, but your environment really kind of led to the kind of company you had. I mean, because, you know, you started off by playing with all these different systems, whether it was the Teabox or, you
        know, the thing from livid or Arduino <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.75" data-end_ts="1742.87" title="1742.75" id=c_"1742.75">__is__</span> you kind of played around with a lot of things and got a comfortable, but also kind of like
        repurposing things and working in a modular way. It seems like you had all kind of set you up for making a business that has sort of like this modular development to it. So I think maybe it's a, maybe it's kind of Val valuable to what you
        went, went through. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Sure. I mean, we are modeled by our environment and the things that we can imagine and do also our model by our environment. So, I'm unsure, all these, background of, getting things done, no matter what it's, it's maybe it's something important
      to, to drive your idea forward again, I will, I will love to be doing this in Finland, but it did, but it didn't happen. So, yeah, I mean, as I said, this makes you a gymnastic that it's, maybe for a pandemic, it's a good thing. I mean, we
      didn't panic. We just, you know, we have a new reality, the inner market in Argentina it's completely gone because 40% of the people are poor. Now they cannot afford our, the things that we are doing. So now we have to sell outside. What we
      need to sell outside is really complicated, the financial part and exporting and all the, and all the things that we have to do, to communication staff and, and, and yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1837.69" data-end_ts="1838.17"
        title="1837.69" id=c_"1837.69">__Ben__</span>, we take it as a given that we have to keep going and, and be creative. We believe in what we are doing. I mean, we, we are here for the money and, but we, we feel that we have something to say
      and, on the creative hardware world and, and we want to keep doing it. And, as long as we have a good feedback from the users and the community, and it's sustainable economically, we will keep going, no matter what,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's fantastic. Let me ask this. How, since you kind of started off by doing a lot of creative stuff, have you been able to keep that up as well? Do you still do music and visuals and performance and stuff like that? I mean, I know the
        pandemic kind of got in a way, but, have you still, have you maintained your, activities in art making? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      Not really, to be honest, no, not really. To be honest, we interact with a lot of equipment inside of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.16" data-end_ts="1904.34" title="1904.16" id=c_"1904.16">__UN__</span> on the regular basis because
      of, of the, of the company. But I had to learn so much stuff to, to pull this off, that I guess on the mentor, it's also, I'm not sad about it, like interest shift in our life and I'm happy where I am now. I was completely focused on that, like
      10 years or 15 years ago, and now my interests, shift to other things. And I'm not sad about it. And, but, but the, the short answer is it's no, I mean, we are, we are now working with the art with other artists, helping them to be creative and
      to do the work. And it's fine like this,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>You're, you're finding that that is, satisfying for you, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      You know, creativity, which is something that, I like it can be expressed in many different ways and it doesn't have to be something that you do in a, in a, in a public space in front of people. I mean, as, as an artist and, we can be creative
      in many other ways, and this is what we do. And as I said, I'm now for example, link trust in, I don't know how companies are organized. And, the next step for us is to build railways for artists to do not only design the controllers, but we
      want to build an ecosystem where artists can also sell their creations on our platform. So for example, that, for me, it's really interesting and I'm seeing I'm really interesting now in cryptocurrencies and all this, not because of the
      cryptocurrencies, per se, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2014.73" data-end_ts="2015.03" title="2014.73" id=c_"2014.73">__any__</span> everything that is going on with Dao and ways to organize communities in a way that the community has
      really the, the main voice where the, the framework or the, the space that they are involved in goals, forward. No, I think it's gonna, it's gonna bring a lot of interesting new type of organizations into put into companies and to, and then to,
      communities and therefore, I think there's a lot to be done there and you can be creative, not only playing music, but, yeah. Designing even how a company is structured or how you interact with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2060.84"
        data-end_ts="2060.9" title="2060.84" id=c_"2060.84">__a__</span>, with a users of a framework and stuff like this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's fantastic. That's really interesting. And boy, I didn't even, I didn't even really think about, like, for example, cryptocurrency being, you know, because it's community driven, it actually has a, has a place in the communities of
        artists that bridge international borders. That's, that's actually a really powerful statement. I thanks for opening that door for me, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      You know, in the theater, I think we'll like to see Yaeltex being a transparent and an open organization in the sense that we will act to have some kind of a boating system where users of the framework can vote, where we can allocate resources,
      what are the new features that are needed, and also to create like a, an alternative revenue stream for them, if they create something interesting, for example, and make the, they add value to the community <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2126.71" data-end_ts="2126.8" title="2126.71" id=c_"2126.71">__or__</span> to the framework, for example, making a new fear more, or designing some implementation with some software or doing a special, you know, a unique, graphic
      design or making video, so help or documentation that they can extract also value from the, from the framework. And also I foresee like more of an open company, if you, if you will. I mean, where, where users have really an influence of where
      we go and they are not, only, you know, someone watching what their clever guy on that company is doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Alejo: </b>
      And not really, really, I think, I think collective intelligence is it's, it's the future. I mean, it's, it's how science is a structure. And I think a community intelligence, something that we have to build in into companies for the future,
      it's something that we have in software, like for a long time, you know, I, I dream by the time that you can have that in hardware too. I mean, in software, there are many examples and there are a lot of beautiful things that are developed by
      the community in Maxwell life and reactor and, and all those environments where users are really the driving force for me, for creativity. And most of the tools that I like are done by the community. And, and I think that is something that we
      have to empower and tap into

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right on, well, Alejo, I want to thank you so much for the time we blew through that. That was really great, but it was really fascinating to hear not only how you grew the company and how you imagined this stuff coming together, but what
        your vision is for the future. I think that you, I think that you have both a powerful, a powerful vision, but also one that's actually attainable because like you said, I think a lot of the things you talk about are things we see in
        software, but we desire that in hardware. And I think that you're really onto something there. </i>
